# Customer-Segmentation-in-Airline-Industry-
One of the challenges in the airline industry is to improve revenue management and optimize resource allocation through a data-driven approach that segments users, enabling differentiated pricing and services. Customer segmentation has been crucial to business because such clustering allows businesses to offer better products that accommodate different needs, create great traveling experiences, and attract various types of travelers through individualized product design. Implementing restriction management will optimize revenue and airline occupancy by offering tickets at varying prices with different restrictions. Failure to do so leads to customers not feeling the travel experience is worth the value of the ticket price paid, which leads to decreased purchase frequency. 

Many companies segment customers by demographic, geographic, and behavioral characteristics. In our research, we propose a model to divide customer segmentation by behaviors, which involves placing the right passenger in the right seat at the right price and at the right time. By categorizing seats into appropriate types of seats and understanding the travel purpose of passengers, which could be business, bleisure, vacation, visiting friends and relatives (VFR), or personal, a systematic, data-driven pricing model could be developed that maximizes fare value per passenger.
